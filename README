Compiling it:
get-eedid:
type make -f Makefile.get-eedid
Needs libi2c from i2c-tools and probably linux-headers.

parse-edid: (deprecated)
type make -f Makefile.parse-edid
Shouldn't need anything special.

Running it:
USAGE: get-eedid [-s] [-d] [-o <output template>] <device path>
-s      SMBus mode.
-d      DDC2B mode.
-o      Output template, in DDC2B mode '{}' will be replaced
    with the page number.  In SMBus mode, it'll just be omitted.
<device path> Path to i2c device.

)deprecated)
USAGE: parse-edid <edid file>


parse-edid2:
Not very familiar with python packaging so no idea if the setup.py works but
you can just run parse-edid2.py from the directory it's in anyway.  You will
probably need the kaitaistruct runtime.  Only tested with python 3.6, probably
works on some earlier 3.x pythons, haven't tested any 2.x ones and don't
really care to.

Running it:
./parse-edid2.py <path to edid dump>
