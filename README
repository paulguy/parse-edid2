Compiling it:
get-eedid:
type make -f Makefile.get-eedid
Needs libi2c from i2c-tools and probably linux-headers.

parse-edid:
type make -f Makefile.parse-edid
Shouldn't need anything special.

Running it:
USAGE: get-eedid [-s] [-d] [-o <output template>] <device path>
-s      SMBus mode.
-d      DDC2B mode.
-o      Output template, in DDC2B mode '{}' will be replaced
    with the page number.  In SMBus mode, it'll just be omitted.
<device path> Path to i2c device.

USAGE: parse-edid <edid file>
