More complete python version of the EDID parser.

Uses kaitai struct so you'll need the runtime for that.

Tested with python 3.6 but probably works with earlier ones.

just run it with ./parse-edid2.py <path to edid dump>

I don't know how python packaging works so no idea if that setup.py does
anything useful or not.
